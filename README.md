This is website that I create for the data as material class at Parsons.

Description of  the project: 

Find an existing poem or piece of text to typeset. The text should already be written by someone else
whom you donâ€™t know, and should easily fit on one printed page. You will make 20 variations of this
text. Each variation will be a separate webpage. For each variation, you will focus on changing the
poem's form through shifts in composition, typography, hierarchy, scale, and pacing. The poem's
content must remain intact throughout all 20 variations. Define 5 rules of changes for your poems. For
each of the rule come up with 4 variations each. For example, if the first rule is scale, then invent 4
significantly different ways of scaling the text.
